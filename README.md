A good `README.md` explains **what your project is**, **how to install and run it**, and **how others can contribute or deploy it**.

Since your project is a **Chainlit + Gemini chatbot**, here is a detailed and clean `README.md` you can copy and edit:

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmeerHamza005/chainlit-gemini-chat.git
cd chainlit-gemini-chat
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` is not created, you can install manually:

```bash
pip install chainlit python-dotenv google-generativeai
```

4. **Set up your `.env` file with your Gemini API key:**

Create a file called `.env` in the project folder and add:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

5. **Run the chatbot:**

```bash
chainlit run main.py
```

Then open the local web URL (usually `http://localhost:8000`) in your browser.

## ðŸ“„ Sample `.env` file

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...your_key
```

## ðŸ“„ Sample `chat_history.json`
